    <h1>A little about me</h1>
    <p>I'm Manzur Khan Sarguru, a twentyish year old Frontend Developer. I hail from Mumbai. I'm a Mechanical Engineer by profession but please don't ask me to fix your car or your refrigerator. I neither do it nor I know how to do it😛</p>
    <p>I started my Web Development career just after I graduated. Having spent four years in Mechanical Engineering, I finally realised it's not something what I wanted to do. Also I had craze for tech since childhood and stumbled upon web development, learned it, practiced its, made apps with my learning, got a job and here I am, a Web Developer.</p>
